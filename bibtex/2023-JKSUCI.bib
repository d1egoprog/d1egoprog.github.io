abstract = {Knowledge representation (KR) is vital in designing symbolic notations to represent real-world facts and facilitate automated decision-making tasks. Knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged so far as a popular form of KR, offering a contextual and human-like representation of knowledge. In international economics, KGs have proven valuable in capturing complex interactions between commodities, companies, and countries. By putting the gravity model, which is a common economic framework, into the process of building KGs, important factors that affect trade relationships can be taken into account, making it possible to predict international trade patterns. This paper proposes an approach that leverages Knowledge Graph embeddings for modeling international trade, focusing on link prediction using embeddings. Thus, valuable insights are offered to policymakers, businesses, and economists, enabling them to anticipate the effects of changes in the international trade system. Moreover, the integration of traditional machine learning methods with KG embeddings, such as decision trees and graph neural networks are also explored. The research findings demonstrate the potential for improving prediction accuracy and provide insights into embedding explainability in knowledge representation. The paper also presents a comprehensive analysis of the influence of embedding methods on other intelligent algorithms.},
